## Microservices

### 1. Auth Service

#### Overview

The Auth Service is a microservice built with Node.js and Express, designed to handle authentication functionalities in a microservices architecture. This service interacts with RabbitMQ for efficient and scalable communication within the microservices ecosystem.

#### Features

- User authentication (login and logout)
- JWT-based token generation and validation
- Integration with RabbitMQ for inter-service communication

#### Prerequisites

Before running the Auth Service, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- RabbitMQ
